## Key Components

### ConversationHandler

- Manages emotion-aware conversations
- Processes user inputs with context awareness
- Generates appropriate responses based on emotional state
- Maintains conversation flow and context

### CrisisDetector

- Analyzes text for crisis indicators using regex patterns
- Assigns severity levels (1-5 scale)
- Triggers appropriate intervention responses
- Provides immediate resource recommendations

### Flask Routes

- `/` - Main chat interface (requires authentication)
- `/login` - User authentication
- `/chat` - API endpoint for message processing
- `/counselors` - Professional resources
- `/services` - Emergency services
- `/firebase-config` - Secure Firebase configuration endpoint
- `/user/activity` - Activity tracking

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for session management
- `FLASK_ENV`: Application environment (development/production)
- `FIREBASE_API_KEY`: Firebase API key for web app
- `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`: Firebase authentication domain
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`: Firebase project identifier
- `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`: Firebase storage bucket
- `FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`: Firebase messaging sender ID
- `FIREBASE_APP_ID`: Firebase application ID
- `FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`: Firebase analytics measurement ID

### Crisis Detection Patterns

The system detects various crisis keywords and phrases:

- **Level 5 (Critical)**: Suicide ideation, self-harm
- **Level 4 (High)**: Safety concerns, abuse, harassment
- **Level 3 (Medium)**: Hopelessness, inability to cope

## Usage

1. **Start a Conversation**: Navigate to the main page and begin chatting
2. **Emotional Support**: The AI will detect your emotional state and respond appropriately
3. **Crisis Support**: If crisis indicators are detected, immediate resources will be provided
4. **Professional Help**: Access counselor directory and emergency services as needed

## Safety Features

- **Immediate Crisis Response**: Automatic detection and response to crisis situations
- **Professional Resource Integration**: Direct links to emergency services and counselors
- **Privacy Protection**: Secure session management and data handling
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with supportive error messages

## Security

### API Key Protection

- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive configuration (Firebase API keys, secrets) stored in `.env` file
- **Secure Configuration Endpoint**: Firebase config served dynamically via `/firebase-config` route
- **Git Security**: `.env` file excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
- **Template Configuration**: `.env.example` provided for easy setup without exposing secrets

### Best Practices

- Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Regularly rotate API keys and secrets
- Monitor for any accidental exposure of credentials
